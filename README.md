## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Task Planner Agent (`main.py`)
- Analyzes user queries and generates execution plans
- Creates task schemas with success criteria
- No hardcoded task-specific logic

#### 2. Universal Browsing Agent (`main.py`)
- Executes tasks using intelligent browser automation
- Implements chain-of-thought reasoning
- Handles failures and retry logic

#### 3. Liquid Glass UI (`liquid_glass_server.py`, `liquid_glass_ui.html`)
- Beautiful glass-morphism interface
- Real-time task monitoring
- Interactive chat for post-task questions

#### 4. Configuration System (`config.py`)
- Flexible settings for all aspects of the system
- Reliability vs speed trade-offs
- Memory optimization options

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Universal Approach**: No task-specific code paths. The system analyzes any request and generates appropriate strategies dynamically.

**Chain of Thought**: Every action, thought, and decision is tracked for transparency and debugging.

**Reliability First**: Conservative navigation, aggressive retry logic, and comprehensive error handling prioritize success over speed.

**Safety Boundaries**: Automatic detection and stopping at login pages, payment forms, and other sensitive areas.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The system is highly configurable through `config.py`:

### Browser Settings
```python
HEADLESS_MODE = False           # Show/hide browser window
WAIT_BETWEEN_ACTIONS = 1.0      # Delay between actions
BROWSER_WIDTH = 1920            # Window dimensions
BROWSER_HEIGHT = 1080
```

### Agent Behavior
```python
MAX_STEPS_DEFAULT = 50          # Default step limit
RELIABILITY_MODE = True         # Enable all reliability features
USE_VISION = True              # Screenshot analysis
USE_THINKING = True            # AI reasoning
```

### Memory Optimization
```python
MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION = True      # Enable memory optimizations
MAX_HISTORY_ITEMS = 15         # Limit history size
MAX_PAGE_SIZE_MB = 50          # Skip large pages
```

### Scroll Behavior
```python
SCROLL_SETTINGS = {
    "conservative_scrolling": True,
    "default_scroll_pages": 0.3,    # 30% viewport scrolling
    "overlap_scrolling": True,      # Content overlap
}
```

## üé® Liquid Glass UI

The Liquid Glass UI provides a stunning visual interface for monitoring and interacting with the agent:

### Features
- **Glass Morphism Design**: Modern translucent interface with smooth animations
- **3D Flip Animation**: Hover to flip between task summary and interactive chat
- **Chain of Thought Display**: See exactly what the agent is thinking
- **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions about the process and results
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress monitoring during task execution

### Usage
The UI automatically opens when tasks complete. You can:
1. **View Task Summary**: See what was accomplished and how
2. **Hover to Chat**: Flip the interface to ask questions
3. **Get Details**: Ask about websites visited, steps taken, or results found

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Automatic Safety Boundaries
- **Private Information Tasks**: Stops at login pages (never enters credentials)
- **Purchase Tasks**: Stops at cart confirmation (never completes payments)
- **Travel Booking**: Stops at booking forms (never enters payment details)

### Error Prevention
- **Action Loop Detection**: Prevents infinite repetition of failed actions
- **Tab Management**: Smart handling of new tabs and page transitions
- **Memory Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion on long tasks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tries alternative approaches when primary methods fail

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Model Configuration
```python
agent = GeneralizableBrowsingAgent(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",          # Use faster/cheaper model
    headless=True,                # Run without GUI
    enable_liquid_glass=False     # Disable UI for automation
)
```

### Batch Task Processing
```python
tasks = [
    "Find weather in Boston",
    "Check Apple stock price", 
    "Search for pizza restaurants nearby"
]

results = []
for task in tasks:
    result = await agent.execute_any_task(task)
    results.append(result)
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
from config import get_config

# Modify settings
config = get_config()
config["max_steps"] = 100
config["wait_between_actions"] = 0.5

# Use custom config
agent = GeneralizableBrowsingAgent(**config)
```
